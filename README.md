WIP rewrite going back to Lozza's roots.

### Lozza

A hand-coded Javascript UCI chess engine that is easily deployed in web-based projects.

Lozza can be used with chess user interfaces like CuteChess via Node, which is available for most platforms.

Lozza uses a traditional evaluation function with features that are easily adjusted for playing style.

### Limitations

- No ```stop``` command.
- No multi-threading.
- No pondering.

### Examples

Note that ```lozza.js``` must be invoked in a web worker.
