# Lozza

A UCI Javascript chess engine with [NNUE evaluation](https://github.com/op12no2/lozza/wiki/Lozza's-net). Try her here:-

https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/play.htm

Lozza was primarily created for use in browsers, but can also be used with traditional chess UIs via Node - and because of that, on pretty-much any platform. 

There is also a C version of Lozza available here: https://github.com/op12no2/cwtch

The code is best read using a folding editor. Start/end fold markers are ```/*{{{  fold name*/``` and ```/*}}}*/```.

## Basic use in a browser

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the latest ```lozzaN.zip``` release.  

https://github.com/op12no2/lozza/releases

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');      

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             // assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         // parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // lozza uses the uci communication protocol
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset tt
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```
