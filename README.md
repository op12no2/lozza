WIP rewrite with new goals.

### Lozza

A UCI Javascript chess engine.

### Goals

- Single file. Hand-coded Javascript so that it can be easily tweaked/deployed.
- Binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac Arm/x86 for use with chess user interfaces.
- Binaries must embed a Javascript run-time (not be a result of a port to C for example).
- i.e. regardless of platform or delivery, Lozza is always running as Javascript.

### Features

- Hand coded evaluation.
- 0x88 board and move generation.
- Principal Variation Search.

### Limitations

- No ```stop``` command.
- No multi-threading.
- No pondering.
