## Play Lozza in chess user interfaces

This can be done using a batch file and full path names are recommended.
```
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe "c:\path\to\lozza.js"

``` 
Then use the batch file to load Lozza into the user interface. Email me if you get any problems ```op12no2@gmail.com``` or PM ```@xyzzy``` on discord.

## Basic use in a browser

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the latest release.  

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
const lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');
const ucioutput = document.getElementById('ucioutput');

lozza.onmessage = function(e) {
  ucioutput.textContent += e.data + '\n'; // Lozza reponds with text as per UCI 
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');
```
