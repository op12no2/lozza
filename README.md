# Lozza

Lozza was a Javascript project with two goals:-

1. To provide a relatively strong UCI chess engine that could be easily included in web projects (examples below).

2. To see how well a traditional (no NNUE, no bitboards) Javascript chess engine running under ```Node.js``` could do in the CCRL chess engine rating list (there were none at the time). Lozza's algorithms are based on the Chess Programming Wiki and it's evaluation function was inspired by Fabien Letouzey's Fruit 2.1. Lozza acheived a rating of 2700.   

## Basic use in web pages

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the root of the repo.  

Here is a little example to do a 10 ply search:-

```Javascript
var lozza = new Worker('lozza.js');

lozza.onmessage = function (e) {
  $('#dump').append(e.data);             //assuming jquery and a div called #dump
                                         //parse messages from here as required
};

lozza.postMessage('uci');                // lozza uses the uci communication protocol
lozza.postMessage('ucinewgame');         // reset tt
lozza.postMessage('position startpos');
lozza.postMessage('go depth 10');        // 10 ply search
```

Please note that Lozza's code is folded using ```{{{``` and ```}}}``` (emacs convention) and most easily read using an editor with a folding capability.

## More examples

A sister repo has more examples for playing and analysing etc. with Lozza.

## Play Lozza offline in chess user interfaces

As a UCI engine Lozza can be used in popular chesss user interfaces like Banksia, Winboard, Arena and CuteChess. Download the latest release and then follow the instructions in the ```readme.txt``` file.  Any platform that supports ```Node.js``` can be targetted.
