### Lozza

A hand-coded Javascript UCI chess engine that is easily deployed in web-based projects.

Lozza (currently) uses the PESTO evaluation function and is around 2350 Elo.

### Limitations

- No ```stop``` command.
- No multi-threading.
- No pondering.
- No multi-PV.

### Examples

All you need is ```lozza.js``` from the repo root. Note that ```lozza.js``` must be invoked in a web worker.
